# Spartle

Spartle is a Wordle clone built with React.js. The words are SPA-themed words and are picked based on the current date (updated every weekday). The project is organized into five React components: [Game](./src/components/Game.js), [Row](./src/components/Row.js), [Square](./src/components/Square.js), [Keyboard](./src/components/Keyboard/Keyboard.js) and [Key](./src/components/Keyboard/Key.js). The repository includes two final renderings of the game: [Spartle](https://henryburkhardt.github.io/spartle) (the full normal Worlde game) and [SpartleEmbed](https://henryburkhardt.github.io/spartle/#/embed) (a version without the Keyboard that can be easily embeded on other websites) and two previews for the game that can also be embeded [SpartlePreview](https://henryburkhardt.github.io/spartle/#/preview) and [SpartlePreviewMobile](https://henryburkhardt.github.io/spartle/#/preview-mobile).
