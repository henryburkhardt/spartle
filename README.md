# Spartle

Spartle is a Wordle clone built with React.js. The words are SPA-themed words and are picked based on the current date (updated every weekday). The project is organized into five React components: [Game](./src/components/Game.js), [Row](./src/components/Row.js), [Square](./src/components/Square.js), [Keyboard](./src/components/Keyboard/Keyboard.js) and [Key](./src/components/Keyboard/Key.js).
